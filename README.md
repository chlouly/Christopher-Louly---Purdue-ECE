# Christopher-Louly---Purdue-ECE
A collection of documents to illustrate the quality of Christopher Louly's code.

Hello!

This repo is dedicated to illustrating the different skills that I have learned 
throughout my programming assignments in the past. Please note that this repository 
does not demonstrate every skill that I have learned, things have been left out.
Examples include particle interaction simulation in VPython, Image processing in
MATLAB, etc. Please enjoy!

Sincerely,

Christopher Louly

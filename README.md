# Christopher-Louly---Purdue-ECE
A collection of documents to illustrate the quality of Christopher Louly's code.

Projects include:
    **Reverse Polish Notation calculator**:     (Corresponds to Assignment 12 in ECE 26400)
         A program that computes expressions in reverse polish notation (format: float float operand), 
         this program supports the use of addition "+", subtraction "-", multiplication "* ", and division "/"
         Example:   10 2 / 0 4 + * = 20, 
         Which is equivalent to: (10 / 2) * (0 + 4) = 20
    **Depth First Search Maze Solver**:
         A program that creates a linked list containing all solution paths to a maze file, comprized of a 
         line shwoing the dimensions of the maze on top, and a grid of characters that can take any of 
         the following values:
                '#': wall, a square that cannot be enhabitted
                's': start, the starting position in the maze
                'e': end, ending position of the maze
                '.': pathway, a space that can be enhabbited
         Example input:           Output:
                4 5
